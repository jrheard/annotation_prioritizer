* subagents
    TODO i'm not sure about the difference between, like, "persona" agents vs sub-agents as a means of avoiding context pollution
* claude github actions
* add more pyright rules
* set up pyright to detect circular imports in precommit (but not in default runs to avoid confusing vs code)
