Write a detailed implementation plan to a markdown file in plans/pending/ (descriptive-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md). Include:
- Full implementation steps (broken down into individual small-to-medium-sized atomic commits) with context
  - **IMPORTANT**: This project enforces 100% test coverage
  - Each commit must include both implementation AND tests (except for pure refactoring)
  - Each commit must maintain 100% test coverage and pass all pre-commit hooks
  - After each commit, the codebase must be in a working state
- Recommended file structures
- Example code snippets where helpful
- Any assumptions or dependencies

Do NOT include time estimates or "estimated duration" sections - these are not helpful and should be omitted.

Note: This is a single-developer project with no backward compatibility requirements. Feel free to propose breaking changes if they improve the codebase.

The plan will be used by another developer, so be thorough and clear. ultrathink and use the sequential thinking tool.
