Write a detailed implementation plan to a markdown file in plans/pending/ (descriptive-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md). Include:
- Full implementation steps (broken down into individual small-to-medium-sized commits) with context
- Recommended file structures
- Example code snippets where helpful
- Any assumptions or dependencies

Do NOT include time estimates or "estimated duration" sections - these are not helpful and should be omitted.

The plan will be used by another developer, so be thorough and clear. ultrathink and use the sequential thinking tool.
