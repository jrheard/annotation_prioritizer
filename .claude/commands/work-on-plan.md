Find the next pending commit in the implementation plan that's ready to be worked on.
Implement that commit completely, including all code and tests.
Implement ONLY that one commit, don't move on to the next commits after that.
BEFORE committing your changes, update the plan file to mark the task as completed and reflect any progress made.
If you've completed the last commit in the plan file, move the file from the pending/ directory to the completed/ directory.
You should only be making ONE commit, and ALL of your changes (including updating the plan doc) should be in that commit.
Use the sequential thinking tool.
