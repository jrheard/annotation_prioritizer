# Update Project Status Document

You are tasked with performing a comprehensive update of the project status document (`docs/project_status.md`). This requires thorough codebase analysis to identify what has changed since the document was last updated and ensuring all sections accurately reflect the current implementation state.

## Process

ultrathink and use the sequential thinking tool to systematically analyze the codebase and update the status document.

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Codebase Research

Perform an exhaustive analysis of the current codebase state:

1. **Implementation Inventory**
   - Examine all Python source files in `src/annotation_prioritizer/`
   - Catalog all implemented features, classes, and functions
   - Note any new modules or significant refactoring

2. **Test Coverage Analysis**
   - Review test files in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
   - Identify what functionality is tested vs untested
   - Check for any skipped or marked tests indicating known issues

3. **Bug Discovery**
   - Search for TODO/FIXME/XXX comments in the codebase
   - Look for workarounds or defensive coding patterns
   - Examine test cases that might reveal edge cases or limitations

4. **Configuration and Infrastructure**
   - Review `pyproject.toml` for dependency changes
   - Check `.devcontainer/`, CI/CD configs for infrastructure updates
   - Examine pre-commit hooks and linting configuration

5. **Recent Changes**
   - Use git log to identify recent commits and their purposes
   - Look for patterns of repeated fixes indicating persistent issues
   - Check for any reverted commits or emergency fixes

### Phase 2: Document Analysis

Read the current `docs/project_status.md` and identify:

1. **Outdated Information**
   - Features listed as "planned" that are now implemented
   - Bugs marked as "known" that have been fixed
   - Limitations that no longer exist
   - Missing features that have been added

2. **Inaccurate Descriptions**
   - Implementation details that have changed
   - Incorrect file paths or module names
   - Outdated code examples
   - Wrong statistics or metrics

3. **Missing Information**
   - New features not documented
   - Recently discovered bugs not listed
   - Important architectural changes not reflected
   - New limitations or known issues

### Phase 3: Document Update

Update `docs/project_status.md` with:

1. **Accurate Current State**
   - Move completed items from "In Progress" to "Completed"
   - Update bug statuses (fixed, still present, newly discovered)
   - Reflect actual implementation vs planned implementation
   - Update code examples to match current codebase

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Add any new features or capabilities
   - Document newly discovered limitations
   - Include important implementation decisions
   - Update planned features based on recent learnings

3. **Clear Organization**
   - Maintain consistent section structure
   - Use clear status indicators (‚úÖ, üöß, ‚ùå, üêõ)
   - Keep chronological notes where relevant
   - Preserve important historical context

### Phase 4: Validation

Before finalizing:

1. **Cross-Reference**
   - Verify all file paths mentioned exist
   - Confirm code examples are accurate
   - Check that feature descriptions match implementation

2. **Completeness Check**
   - Ensure no major features are undocumented
   - Verify all known issues are captured
   - Confirm planned features align with project goals

### Phase 5: Commit

Create a commit with:
- Message format: `docs: update project status to reflect current implementation`
- Include brief summary of major changes in extended description if significant updates were made

## Important Notes

- Be thorough but concise in descriptions
- Preserve valuable historical context and decisions
- Don't remove "Out of Scope" items unless explicitly implemented
- Maintain the document's role as single source of truth
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of the document

Remember: This document is the authoritative reference for project state. Accuracy is paramount.
