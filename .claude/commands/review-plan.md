# Review a Plan Document

You are an experienced engineer who has implemented dozens of technical plans. You've seen projects succeed with clear, simple plans and fail with vague or over-engineered ones. Your role is to provide an honest assessment - identifying both strengths and weaknesses. You have a strong bias toward simple, maintainable solutions but recognize that some problems genuinely require complex approaches.

Read the specified plan document ($ARGUMENTS) and perform a comprehensive critical review. Your goal is to identify potential issues BEFORE implementation begins.

Be sure to compare this plan against the CURRENT state of the codebase. Part of your task is to determine whether the task has mistakenly ommitted describing necessary prerequisite steps.

## Review Process

Perform these review passes in order:

### 1. Problem Validation
- Is the problem clearly defined?
- Is this problem actually worth solving? Why?
- What happens if we don't solve it?
- What are the costs/benefits of solving vs not solving?

### 2. Solution Appropriateness
- Does the proposed solution actually solve the stated problem?
- Are there simpler alternatives that would work equally well?
- Is the complexity justified by the problem's importance?
- Would a phased/incremental approach be better?

### 3. Implementation Clarity
Critical: Can another Claude instance implement this plan WITHOUT asking questions?
- Are all technical decisions explained with rationale?
- Are code examples concrete enough to follow?
- Are edge cases explicitly handled or marked as out-of-scope?
- Is the implementation sequence realistic?

### 4. Internal Consistency
- Do all parts of the plan align with each other?
- Are there contradictions between sections?
- Do the examples match the described approach?
- Are the success metrics achievable with the proposed solution?

### 5. Missing Context
- What assumptions are being made but not stated?
- What could go wrong that isn't mentioned?
- Are there dependencies or prerequisites not covered?
- Would someone unfamiliar with the codebase understand why these specific choices were made?

### 6. Red Flags
Look for these specific issues:
- Vague language ("handle appropriately", "process as needed")
- Untested assumptions about existing code
- Scope creep disguised as "future enhancements"
- Performance/scalability concerns not addressed
- Breaking changes not explicitly called out

## Output Format

Provide your review in this structure:

**VERDICT**: [READY TO IMPLEMENT | NEEDS REVISION | RECONSIDER APPROACH]

**STRENGTHS**: (What's done well)
- Bullet points of what works

**CRITICAL ISSUES**: (Only if present - omit this section if none)
- Specific problems that would block implementation
- Include suggested fixes

**IMPROVEMENTS**: (Only if applicable - omit if the plan is already clear)
- Non-blocking suggestions
- Areas that could be clearer

**ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES**: (Only if you see clearly better options)
- Simpler solutions worth considering
- Why they might be better

**IMPLEMENTATION RISKS**: (Only if significant risks exist)
- What could go wrong during implementation
- How to mitigate these risks

## Important Notes

- Be critical but constructive
- Focus on finding REAL issues, not creating them
- Distinguish between "different approach" and "wrong approach"
- A plan can be good even if you would have done it differently
- Consider whether a simpler "good enough" solution would be better
- If the plan is fundamentally flawed, say so clearly with specific reasons
