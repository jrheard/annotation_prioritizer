Create a detailed GitHub issue using the `gh issue create` command. The issue should include:

1. A clear, descriptive title
2. Problem description with current vs expected behavior
3. Root cause analysis if applicable
4. Proposed solution or implementation approach
5. Testing requirements
6. Acceptance criteria as checkboxes
7. Any relevant code examples or error messages

Focus on the specific scope of work being requested. Do not include speculative future enhancements or "phase 2" work unless the user explicitly asks for it. Keep the issue focused and actionable.

Use proper markdown formatting with headers, code blocks, and bullet points. Always use the `gh issue create` command with `--title` and `--body` flags, using a heredoc for the body to ensure proper formatting.

After creating the issue, provide the issue URL so I can reference it.
