# Discarded Plans Directory

This directory contains planning documents that were considered but ultimately discarded or superseded by different approaches. These documents are preserved for historical context and to understand the evolution of project thinking.

**Important**: Plans in this directory represent ideas we thought about doing but decided NOT to do, or decided to implement in a fundamentally different way. They should not be used as current guidance for the project.

When working on the codebase, treat these documents as historical artifacts that show what was considered and rejected, rather than as actionable plans or current project direction.
