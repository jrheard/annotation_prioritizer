got claude set up
got dev container running after a lot of back and forth
and more and more tweaks. but now i think it's good

my goodness, is it time to actually get started?

no :)
i'm forwarding 21 ports atm, they're accumulating more and more
ok fixed

ok let's get started i guess!

DONE add "even better toml" extension

tried to add a lint-on-edit hook but couldn't get it working, maybe someday - TODO

added pyright

added 100% coverage hook

update original plan to reflect progress from initial_implemenation_plan?
or don't, and just use both of those files when making the next plan?

TODO be sure to pick up the "future enhancement needed" note in commit 4 of initial_implementation_plan

TODO next up should be updating this to run on a _directory_ rather than a single file

DONE verify that we're treating self and cls correctly (they count as annotated)

DONE have a subagent for specifically dealing with linting / type-checking issues?

DONE update claude.md to talk about workspace/demo_files dir

TODO have a slash command for critically analyzing a plan file, looking for ways in which it's inconsistent with project goals, look for ways in which it's ambiguous / self-contradictory, generate detailed recommendations about any suggested changes

DONE have a slash command that reviews tests (with $arguments) and looks for duplicated / overly verbose code that can be improved by using helper functions

DONE use new /test-quality command

DONE count_function_calls() docstring is too brief - any others?

DONE add github action that runs pre-commit hooks on whole codebase

TODO figure out what to work on next!! probably the method call attribution bug, plan in pending/ dir!!

TODO read https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action?tab=readme-ov-file#-solutions--use-cases
