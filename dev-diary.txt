9/12

got claude set up
got dev container running after a lot of back and forth
and more and more tweaks. but now i think it's good

my goodness, is it time to actually get started?

no :)
i'm forwarding 21 ports atm, they're accumulating more and more
ok fixed

ok let's get started i guess!

DONE add "even better toml" extension

tried to add a lint-on-edit hook but couldn't get it working, maybe someday - TODO

added pyright

added 100% coverage hook

update original plan to reflect progress from initial_implemenation_plan?
or don't, and just use both of those files when making the next plan?

TODO be sure to pick up the "future enhancement needed" note in commit 4 of initial_implementation_plan

TODO next up should be updating this to run on a _directory_ rather than a single file

TODO verify that we're treating self and cls correctly (they count as annotated)
